make sure package.json is fully populated with all dependencies
add a start script to package.json in the scripts key: {"start": "node app.js"}
git init (if git isn't already set up) for the project in the dev environment.
add and commit all files to master that you want to deploy
in fully set up (for heroku) dev environment (C9 is set up already), in terminal:
     heroku login -i
        log in
     heroku create   
        (this will generate an random-named url associated with this git repo)
        (this also creates a git remote named "heroku" -- see the associated urls by typing in terminal:  git remote -v)
        (we can push to and fetch from the heroku remote.  Pushing to heroku is how we get our code onto the server.)
     git push heroku master
        (pushes our master to heroku)
     heroku logs  (type this in C9 terminal if you need to see error messages for debugging)

notes:
    After "create" heroku dashboard will show our app and assorted info about it.
    Can run terminal commands on heroku server.  Ex. "heroku run ls" will do "ls" on heroku.
