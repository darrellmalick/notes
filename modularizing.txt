make a directory called "models" in the same directory level as "views"
make a file such as "posts.js" in that dir:  touch models/post.js
copy mongoose Schema and Model segments into the file.
use module.exports.  This line sends something out of the file, kind of like a "return" in a function.
   It looks like you can export an object or a model or a function (which is an object I suppose).
require mongoose in this file
require this file in app.js

Example:
./models/campground.js file:
-------------
var mongoose=require("mongoose");

var campgroundSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
   name: String,
   image: String,
   description: String
});

var Campground = mongoose.model("Campground", campgroundSchema);
module.exports=Campground;
//last two lines can be combined.  I left separate to emphasize we're exporting a variable which is an (model) object.
---------------


app.js file:
---------------
var Campground=require(./models/campground");
