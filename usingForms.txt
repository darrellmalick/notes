You need body-parser to get data out of a form.  app.js should include:
var bodyParser = require("body-parser");
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true}));


In the form declaration, looks like this:

<form action="/register" method="POST">
    <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="username"></input>
    <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="password"></input>
    <button>Submit</button>  <!--html tip: as long as the button is at the end of the form it will submit the form-->
</form>

This form sends a POST request to "/register"
Note that you can just use a button at the END of the form and it will submit the data.
