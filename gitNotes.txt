git add -A                      //adds all files and directories to staging area.  
git add .                       //adds all new and changed files to staging area.

git branch                      //shows all the branches in your repo.
git checkout <branch-name> -b   //make a new branch and switch to it.

(from branch master)
git merge <branch-name>         //merge branch-name into master.

git branch -d <branch-name>     //delete branch-name.  This should be a fairly rare operation.

git remote -v                   //see what remotes are set up.

(to push updates from C9 to Git)
git push -u origin master       //this is the initial push command to get repo cloned to github.
git push origin master          //this seems to work fine after initial push.
